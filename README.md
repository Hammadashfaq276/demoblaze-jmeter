🧩 Types of Performance Testing Implemented
1️⃣ Load Testing

Simulates expected user load

Validates application performance under normal and peak load

Metrics: Response time, throughput, error rate

2️⃣ Stress Testing

Determines application breaking point

Simulates higher than normal load to check stability

Identifies bottlenecks

3️⃣ Spike Testing

Sudden increase in users for short duration

Evaluates system’s reaction to sudden spikes

Measures recovery time

4️⃣ Endurance (Soak) Testing

Sustained load over a long period

Checks memory leaks, stability, and performance degradation

✅ Key Features
